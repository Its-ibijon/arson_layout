# arson_layout
> a chorded keyboard layout in an attempt to see if it will speed up my typing speed
> **Warning: This is not tested and i am still very slow at typing with it**

- its called arson because the first 4 letters on the keyboard are arsn
# How it Works 
- as seen in the image the `qwertyuiop[`  keys are the only keys that will output text 
- this keyboard uses keys called layers to change what those keys do 
- for example:
   - holding `m` will print out `bcfumhgkl`
   - `S` is shift 
   - `W` is windows/GUI  
   - `E` is enter 
   - `B` is backspace
   - `LUDR` is Left Up Down Right

# V2 includes
- [x] Capital letters
- [x] Mouse input on keyboard
- [x] math notation
- [x] chorded words ->  example : `bcs`  will print out  `because`
