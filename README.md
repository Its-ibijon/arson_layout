- its called arson because the first 4 letters on the keyboard are arsn
# How it Works 
- <img width="215" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-08 220934" src="https://github.com/Its-ibijon/arson_layout/assets/90000954/21f820a7-ae95-45eb-b9d4-a0671a997fca"> 
- as seen in the image the `qwertyuiop[`  keys are the only keys that will output text 
- this keyboard uses keys called layers to change what those keys do 
- for example:
   - holding `m` will print out `bcfumhgkl`
   - `S` is shift 
   - `W` is windows/GUI  
   - `E` is enter 
   - `B` is backspace
   - `LUDR` is Left Up Down Right

this layout will be modified in the future but likely not to heavily
- [ ] Mouse input on keyboard
- [ ] math notation
- [ ] chorded words ->  example : `N + C + T `  will print out  `because`
